                    course={Contracts},
                    facts={Plaintiffs worked at Defendant's pickle company.\ Defendant offered a contract to plaintiffs that added an annual bonus of 10\% of the company's earnings.\ When plaintiffs asked for the contract in writing, one was prepared and sent to them.\ The contract provided no details on how to accept, so plaintiffs simply signed and kept the document.\ After plaintiffs left the company, they filed for breach of contract claiming that they had never been provided the bonuses.\ Defendant objected on the grounds that the contracts had never been returned to them, and therefore were not accepted.},
