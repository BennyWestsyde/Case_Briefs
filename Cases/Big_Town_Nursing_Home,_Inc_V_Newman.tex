In the admission papers, the nursing home indicated that he would not be forced to stay there against his will\. However, when plaintiff attempted to leave, he was forbidden from doing so\. After several more attempts in which he was forcably brought back, the defendant began strapping plaintiff into a chair, locking up his clothes, and did not provide him access to a doctor\. After 51 days, plaintiff was able to escape and make it to Dallas\. He had lost 30 lbs in the days in which he was retained},
