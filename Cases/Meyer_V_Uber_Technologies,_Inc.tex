                    facts={The plaintiff (Meyer) signed up for and used the defendant\'s (Uber\'s) app to request 10 rides.\ Afterwards, Meyer accused Uber of engaging in price fixing and prepared to try to take Uber to trial over the charge.\ Uber requested a motion to compel arbitration per their terms of service agreement.\ Meyer objected to this on the grounds that the terms of service were not made obvious enough when he was registering for the app.\ \\
The terms of service where situated as "browsewrap" terms meaning that a user was given the option to view the terms, but where not forced to, and would "sign" the contract based on clicking "Register".\\
The district court sustained this objection and denied the motion to compel arbitration.},
