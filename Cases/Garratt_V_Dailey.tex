The plaintiff contends that the defendant deliberately pulled a lawn chair out from under her when she went to sit down.\ However, the trial court accepted the defendant\'s explaination that he had pulled the chair for himself to sit in and then, once he realized that the plaintiff was about to sit where the chair used to be, tried to push the chair back under the plaintiff.\ Unfortunately, the chair was too unwieldy for the defendant to properly move so the plaintiff fell and broke her hip.},
